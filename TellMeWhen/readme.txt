TellMeWhen 1.0
by Nephthys <Drunken Monkeys> of Hyjal
--------------------------------------


TellMeWhen provides a flexible system of icons for displaying vital information -- and only vital information -- about cooldowns, buffs, debuffs, and reactive abilities... always in a consistent place on your screen.  

You choose which spells, abilities, items, buffs, and debuffs TellMeWhen shows.  The number, size, and position of icons are all customizable.  Cooldown icons can be shown when an ability/item is either usable or is unusable.  Buff/debuff icons can be shown when the buff/debuff is either present or is absent.  Icons can be set to only show in combat.  

Some examples of things you can do with TellMeWhen: 

- Display an icon when a boost trinket is finished cooling down and is ready to use.  

- Display an icon when a clearcasting buff procs.  

- A warrior could have icons appear to show that Battle Shout has dropped and needs to be refreshed, and to show when Execute is usable.  

- A mage could have a Polymorph icon appear when the mob they've set to focus becomes unsheeped.  

- A rogue could monitor their own stack of Deadly Poison on a raid boss.  

- A warlock could monitor the number of Sunder Armor debuffs on a mob, so they can wait to dps until their warrior tank has enough threat.

Instructions
------------

General options are available in the Blizzard interface options menu.  You can type "/tellmewhen" or "/tmw" to lock/unlock the addon.  To configure individual icons, right click them when unlocked.  

For buffs and debuffs not in your spellbook, TellMeWhen will at first show a pocketwatch icon to indicate that it is waiting to learn the texture for the buff/debuff.  The icon will have the correct texture after you encounter the buff/debuff while playing.  



------------------------------------
Features planned for future versions
------------------------------------

- Raid icons as unit choices to monitor for buffs/debuffs
- Text timers for buffs, debuffs, and cooldowns
- Support for dragging spells/items onto icons
